# Purchase Requisition Approval and Release using SAP Business Technology Platform Workflow Management
## Overview
Purchase Requisition Approval and Release Process enable customers to automate approval and release of Line Items in a flexible and transparent way. It provides flexibility in choosing process variants depending on attributes like Request date, Price, Material Group, Document Type, Plant, Purchasing Group and Purchasing Organization etc. When a requestor creates a Purchase Request with line items in SAP ERP, pre-configured Process Variants are triggered in SAP Business Technology Platform Workflow Management. 
•	Line Item data validated using Business Rules before approval.
•	Approvers are determined using a Business Rule / external system.
•	Approvers are notified via email.
•	Approvers have two decision options (Approve, Reject), and based on the decision, the next approval step will be created or requested for a rework or delete the line item and terminate the approval process.
•	Line Item released in SAP ERP for Purchase Order creation.
